Rust ODBC bindings. ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is an open standard to connect to a variaty of data sources. Most data sources offer ODBC drivers. There are two typical usage scenarios for ODBC:

* Your appliciation is designed to work with a wide range of Databases without the need of redeploying it.
* There is no native Rust driver in suitable quality available for your Database so you want to use the ODBC driver instead.

This crate is currently tested against:

* Microsoft SQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* MariaDB
* SQLite

Current ODBC Version is `3.80`.

This crate is build on top of the `odbc-sys` ffi bindings, which provide definitions of the ODBC C Interface, but do not build any kind of abstraction on top of it.

## Usage

Check the [guide](https://docs.rs/odbc-api/latest/odbc_api/guide/index.html) for code examples and a tour of the features.

## Installation

To build this library you need to link against the `odbc` library of your systems ODBC driver manager. It should be automatically detected by the build. On Windows systems it is preinstalled. On Linux and OS-X [unix-odbc](http://www.unixodbc.org/) must be installed. To create a Connections to a data source, its ODBC driver must also be installed.

### Windows

Nothing to do. ODBC driver manager is preinstalled.

### Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
```

### macOS

You can use homebrew to install unixODBC

```shell
sudo brew install unixodbc
```

**or**

You can use MacPorts to install it

```shell
sudo port install unixodbc
```

**or**

You can also install unixODBC from source:

1. copy the unixODBC-2.3.9.tar.gz file somewhere you can create files and directories
2. gunzip unixODBC*.tar.gz
3. tar xvf unixODBC*.tar
4. `./configure`
5. `make`
6. `sudo make install`

### Linux / OS-X via Nix Flakes

Alternatively, if you're familiar with the Nix ecosystem or want to try it out, [our wiki](https://github.com/pacman82/odbc-api/wiki) has a user contributed example on setting up a dev environment with Nix flakes.
