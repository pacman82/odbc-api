Rust ODBC bindings. ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is an open standard to connect to a variaty of data sources. Most data sources offer ODBC drivers. This crate is currently tested against:

* Microsoft SQL Server
* MariaDB
* SQLite

Current ODBC Version is `3.80`.

This crate is build on top of the `odbc-sys` ffi bindings, which provide definitions of the ODBC C Interface, but do not build any kind of abstraction on top of it.

## Usage

To build this library you need to link against the `odbc` library of your systems ODBC driver manager. It should be automatically detected by the build. On Windows systems it is preinstalled. On Linux and OS-X [unix-odbc](http://www.unixodbc.org/) must be installed. To create a Connections to a data source, its ODBC driver must also be installed.

Check the [guide](https://docs.rs/odbc-api/latest/odbc_api/guide/index.html) for code examples and a tour of the features.
