/// Operations to a statement imply that interior state of the connection might be mutated,
/// depending on the implementation detail of the ODBC driver. According to the ODBC documentation
/// this could always be considered save, since Connection handles are basically described as
/// `Sync`. Yet making connections `Send` could very well lead to different statements on different
/// threads actually changing the connection at the same time and truly relying on the thread safety
/// of the ODBC driver. I am sceptical. Especially if on Linux unixODBC would not be configured to
/// protect connections.
///
/// Note to users of `unixodbc`: You may configure the threading level to make unixodbc
/// synchronize access to the driver (and thereby making them thread safe if they are not thread
/// safe by themself. This may however hurt your performance if the driver would actually be able to
/// perform operations in parallel.
///
/// See: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4207458/using-unixodbc-in-a-multithreaded-concurrent-setting>
///
/// `StatementConnection` however also owns the connection exclusively. Since connections are `Send`
/// it is reasonable to assume this would work even if implementers of the ODBC driver do not care
/// in particular about thread safety.
