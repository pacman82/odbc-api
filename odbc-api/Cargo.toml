[features]
# Experimental feature to enabling narrow function calls.
#
# Many functions which accept string arguments in the ODBC C API come in two different flavours. For
# example `SQLConnect` and `SQLConnectW`. The former are called narrow function calls and the latter
# are called wide. They differ in the type they used to encode characters (`u8` vs `u16`). Sadly
# narrow may not always be assumed to be UTF-8 as it is dependend on the system locale which is
# usually not UTF-8 on windows system. The wide function calls could be relied upon to always be
# UTF-16 on any platform, but do not seem to work well with iodbc.
#
# Currently this library uses wide function call exclusively. This feature can be enabled to cause
# compliation against narrow functions, but it is not fully implemented yet.
#
# Note that this is the encoding used for statement text and other string arguments, not for the
# payload of VARCHAR columns, or other column types in the result set.
narrow=[]

# `odbc-api` uses ODBC 3.80 by default, which is well supported both in windows and on linux through
# `UnixODBC`. Yet iodbc, for now does only support ODBC 3.5, so you can set this flag in order to
# include only symbols available in ODBC 3.5 and create an environment which declares the ODBC
# version to be 3.0 which works together with the iodbc driver manager. If you want to use ODBC 3.5
# please take care to deactivate default features to not have the ODBC version 3.80 feature active
# at the same time.

# The ODBC version your application should declare if it runs on windows, or on linux using
# UnixOdbc.
odbc_version_3_80 = ["odbc-sys/odbc_version_3_80"]

# In order to work with iodbc we need to only use symbols defined in ODBC 3.5. We need to use
# narrow function calls and preferale link against `libiodbc.so` instead of `libodbc.so`.
